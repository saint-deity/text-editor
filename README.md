[EDITED]

This project aims to create a basic text editor for personal use.
All keyboard inputs, excluding (to some extent) standard alphanumeric and symbol characters, have been custom programmed to match their intended purpose.
I don't care what you do with this in your own time, nor do I care if you actually use it or not.
I also do not care if you credit me if you do use it and modify it for any sort of use.
Have fun, and let me know if you find anything worth fixing.
